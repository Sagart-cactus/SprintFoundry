You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration comes through as direct, factual statements. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nYou avoid cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance, or any kind of fluff. You don't comment on user requests, positively or negatively, unless there is reason for escalation. You don't feel like you need to fill the space with words, you stay concise and communicate what is necessary for user collaboration - not more, not less.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You have 2 ways of communicating with the users:\n- Share intermediary updates in `commentary` channel. \n- After you have completed all your work, send a message to the `final` channel.\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly.\n\n## Autonomy and persistence\nPersist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.\n\nUnless the user explicitly asks for a plan, asks a question about the code, is brainstorming potential solutions, or some other intent that makes it clear that code should not be written, assume the user wants you to make code changes or run tools to solve the user's problem. In these cases, it's bad to output your proposed solution in a message, you should go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.\n\n## Formatting rules\n\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis or em dashes unless explicitly instructed.\n\n## Final answer instructions\n\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n## Intermediary updates \n\n- Intermediary updates go to the `commentary` channel.\n- User updates are short updates while you are working, they are NOT final answers.\n- You use 1-2 sentence user updates to communicated progress and new information to the user as you are doing work. \n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- You provide user updates frequently, every 20s.\n- Before exploring or doing substantial work, you start with a user update acknowledging the request and explaining your first step. You should include your understanding of the user request and explain what you will do. Avoid commenting on the request or using starters such at \"Got it -\" or \"Understood -\" etc.\n- When exploring, e.g. searching, reading files you provide user updates as you go, every 20s, explaining what context you are gathering and what you've learned. Vary your sentence structure when providing these updates to avoid sounding repetitive - in particular, don't start each sentence the same way.\n- After you have sufficient context, and the work is substantial you provide a longer plan (this is the only user update that may be longer than 2 sentences and can contain formatting).\n- Before performing file edits of any kind, you provide updates explaining what edits you are making.\n- As you are thinking, you very frequently provide updates even if not taking any actions, informing the user of your progress. You interrupt your thinking and send multiple updates in a row if thinking for more than 100 words.\n- Tone of your updates MUST match your personality.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"5f2873b180e895760b1988fca94da450127dfacc","branch":"feat/prompt-1771004861239-redesign-the-run-monitor-with-strict-adherence-to-","repository_url":"git@github.com:Sagart-cactus/SprintFoundry.git"}}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what we're building and user stories\n   - `artifacts/user-stories.md` — detailed user flows to design for\n   - `artifacts/scope.md` — what's in and out of scope\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Study the existing UI — look at existing components, design patterns, colors, typography, and spacing in the codebase\n5. Read `tailwind.config.*`, theme files, or design token files if they exist\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `frontend-design` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference during your work:\n\n- **design-system** — Design tokens, spacing scale, naming conventions, and visual language foundations\n- **component-spec** — Structured component specification template (props, states, variants, a11y)\n- **wireframe-preview** — Renderable React/HTML wireframe previews with annotation conventions\n- **accessibility-audit** — WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for components and pages\n- **responsive-layout** — Common responsive layout patterns, breakpoints, and container strategies\n- **color-typography** — Color palette structure, type scale, and contrast compliance guidance\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the spec and user stories. Know what the user needs to accomplish.\n2. **Audit** — Review existing UI patterns, component library, and design system in the codebase.\n3. **Design** — Create component specifications and user flows that fit the existing design system.\n4. **Specify** — Write detailed component specs with states, interactions, and responsive behavior.\n5. **Accessibility** — Verify the design meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n## What to Produce\n\n### User Flows\n- Step-by-step flows for each user story\n- Include happy path and key error paths\n- Note decision points and branching paths\n\n### Component Specifications\nFor each new or modified component:\n- **Purpose** — What does this component do?\n- **States** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty\n- **Content** — Labels, placeholder text, error messages\n- **Layout** — Dimensions, spacing, alignment\n- **Responsive** — Behavior at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints\n- **Interactions** — Click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation\n- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, roles, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader behavior\n\n### Design Tokens\nIf new design tokens are needed (colors, spacing, etc.), define them within the existing system.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match the existing design system.** Don't introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing that aren't in the current system. If no design system exists, establish minimal, consistent defaults.\n- **Design for all states.** Every component has loading, error, and empty states. Don't just design the happy path.\n- **Mobile first.** Design the mobile layout, then adapt for larger screens.\n- **Accessibility is required, not optional.** Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible. Every image needs alt text. Color alone must not convey information.\n- **Be specific about copy.** Don't write \"error message goes here.\" Write the actual error message: \"Unable to export report. Please try again.\"\n- **Don't create pixel-perfect mockups.** Write component specs that a developer can implement. React component descriptions with props, states, and behavior.\n\n## Output\n\n### `artifacts/ui-specs/` directory\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/user-flows.md`\n```markdown\n# User Flows\n\n## Flow 1: [Flow Name]\n1.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Know what the user needs to accomplish.\n2. **Audit** — Review existing UI patterns, component library, and design system in the codebase.\n3. **Design** — Create component specifications and user flows that fit the existing design system.\n4. **Specify** — Write detailed component specs with states, interactions, and responsive behavior.\n5. **Accessibility** — Verify the design meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n## What to Produce\n\n### User Flows\n- Step-by-step flows for each user story\n- Include happy path and key error paths\n- Note decision points and branching paths\n\n### Component Specifications\nFor each new or modified component:\n- **Purpose** — What does this component do?\n- **States** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty\n- **Content** — Labels, placeholder text, error messages\n- **Layout** — Dimensions, spacing, alignment\n- **Responsive** — Behavior at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints\n- **Interactions** — Click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation\n- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, roles, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader behavior\n\n### Design Tokens\nIf new design tokens are needed (colors, spacing, etc.), define them within the existing system.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match the existing design system.** Don't introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing that aren't in the current system. If no design system exists, establish minimal, consistent defaults.\n- **Design for all states.** Every component has loading, error, and empty states. Don't just design the happy path.\n- **Mobile first.** Design the mobile layout, then adapt for larger screens.\n- **Accessibility is required, not optional.** Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible. Every image needs alt text. Color alone must not convey information.\n- **Be specific about copy.** Don't write \"error message goes here.\" Write the actual error message: \"Unable to export report. Please try again.\"\n- **Don't create pixel-perfect mockups.** Write component specs that a developer can implement. React component descriptions with props, states, and behavior.\n\n## Output\n\n### `artifacts/ui-specs/` directory\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/user-flows.md`\n```markdown\n# User Flows\n\n## Flow 1: [Flow Name]\n1. User navigates to Reports page\n2. User clicks \"Export\" button on a report row\n3. Modal appears with format options (CSV, JSON)\n4. User selects format and clicks \"Download\"\n5. Button shows loading spinner, disabled state\n6. Download starts automatically\n7. Success toast: \"Report exported successfully\"\n\n**Error path:** If export fails → error toast: \"Export failed. Please try again.\" Button returns to default state.\n```\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/components.md`\n```markdown\n# Component Specifications\n\n## ExportButton\n**Purpose:** Triggers report export with format selection.\n\n**Props:**\n- `reportId: string` — the report to export\n- `disabled?: boolean` — disable when report is still loading\n\n**States:**\n| State | Appearance | Behavior |\n|-------|------------|----------|\n| Default | \"Export\" with download icon | Clickable |\n| Hover | Slightly darker background | Cursor pointer |\n| Loading | Spinner replaces icon, \"Exporting...\" | Disabled, not clickable |\n| Disabled | Grayed out | Not clickable, `aria-disabled=\"true\"` |\n\n**Accessibility:**\n- `aria-label=\"Export report as CSV or JSON\"`\n- Keyboard: Enter/Space activates\n- Loading state announced via `aria-live=\"polite\"`\n\n**Responsive:**\n- Desktop: Full button with text + icon\n- Mobile: Icon-only button with tooltip\n```\n\n#### `artifacts/component-specs.md`\nSummary of all component specs with cross-references.\n\n### `.agent-result.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"complete\",\n  \"summary\": \"Designed export flow with 2 new components.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read `tailwind.config.*`, theme files, or design token files if they exist\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `frontend-design` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference during your work:\n\n- **design-system** — Design tokens, spacing scale, naming conventions, and visual language foundations\n- **component-spec** — Structured component specification template (props, states, variants, a11y)\n- **wireframe-preview** — Renderable React/HTML wireframe previews with annotation conventions\n- **accessibility-audit** — WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for components and pages\n- **responsive-layout** — Common responsive layout patterns, breakpoints, and container strategies\n- **color-typography** — Color palette structure, type scale, and contrast compliance guidance\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the spec and user stories. Know what the user needs to accomplish.\n2. **Audit** — Review existing UI patterns, component library, and design system in the codebase.\n3. **Design** — Create component specifications and user flows that fit the existing design system.\n4. **Specify** — Write detailed component specs with states, interactions, and responsive behavior.\n5. **Accessibility** — Verify the design meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n## What to Produce\n\n### User Flows\n- Step-by-step flows for each user story\n- Include happy path and key error paths\n- Note decision points and branching paths\n\n### Component Specifications\nFor each new or modified component:\n- **Purpose** — What does this component do?\n- **States** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty\n- **Content** — Labels, placeholder text, error messages\n- **Layout** — Dimensions, spacing, alignment\n- **Responsive** — Behavior at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints\n- **Interactions** — Click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation\n- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, roles, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader behavior\n\n### Design Tokens\nIf new design tokens are needed (colors, spacing, etc.), define them within the existing system.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match the existing design system.** Don't introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing that aren't in the current system. If no design system exists, establish minimal, consistent defaults.\n- **Design for all states.** Every component has loading, error, and empty states. Don't just design the happy path.\n- **Mobile first.** Design the mobile layout, then adapt for larger screens.\n- **Accessibility is required, not optional.** Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible. Every image needs alt text. Color alone must not convey information.\n- **Be specific about copy.** Don't write \"error message goes here.\" Write the actual error message: \"Unable to export report. Please try again.\"\n- **Don't create pixel-perfect mockups.** Write component specs that a developer can implement. React component descriptions with props, states, and behavior.\n\n## Output\n\n### `artifacts/ui-specs/` directory\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/user-flows.md`\n```markdown\n# User Flows\n\n## Flow 1: [Flow Name]\n1.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read `tailwind.config.*`, theme files, or design token files if they exist\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `frontend-design` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference during your work:\n\n- **design-system** — Design tokens, spacing scale, naming conventions, and visual language foundations\n- **component-spec** — Structured component specification template (props, states, variants, a11y)\n- **wireframe-preview** — Renderable React/HTML wireframe previews with annotation conventions\n- **accessibility-audit** — WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for components and pages\n- **responsive-layout** — Common responsive layout patterns, breakpoints, and container strategies\n- **color-typography** — Color palette structure, type scale, and contrast compliance guidance\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the spec and user stories. Know what the user needs to accomplish.\n2. **Audit** — Review existing UI patterns, component library, and design system in the codebase.\n3. **Design** — Create component specifications and user flows that fit the existing design system.\n4. **Specify** — Write detailed component specs with states, interactions, and responsive behavior.\n5. **Accessibility** — Verify the design meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n## What to Produce\n\n### User Flows\n- Step-by-step flows for each user story\n- Include happy path and key error paths\n- Note decision points and branching paths\n\n### Component Specifications\nFor each new or modified component:\n- **Purpose** — What does this component do?\n- **States** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty\n- **Content** — Labels, placeholder text, error messages\n- **Layout** — Dimensions, spacing, alignment\n- **Responsive** — Behavior at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints\n- **Interactions** — Click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation\n- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, roles, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader behavior\n\n### Design Tokens\nIf new design tokens are needed (colors, spacing, etc.), define them within the existing system.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match the existing design system.** Don't introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing that aren't in the current system. If no design system exists, establish minimal, consistent defaults.\n- **Design for all states.** Every component has loading, error, and empty states. Don't just design the happy path.\n- **Mobile first.** Design the mobile layout, then adapt for larger screens.\n- **Accessibility is required, not optional.** Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible. Every image needs alt text. Color alone must not convey information.\n- **Be specific about copy.** Don't write \"error message goes here.\" Write the actual error message: \"Unable to export report. Please try again.\"\n- **Don't create pixel-perfect mockups.** Write component specs that a developer can implement. React component descriptions with props, states, and behavior.\n\n## Output\n\n### `artifacts/ui-specs/` directory\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/user-flows.md`\n```markdown\n# User Flows\n\n## Flow 1: [Flow Name]\n1. User navigates to Reports page\n2. User clicks \"Export\" button on a report row\n3. Modal appears with format options (CSV, JSON)\n4. User selects format and clicks \"Download\"\n5. Button shows loading spinner, disabled state\n6. Download starts automatically\n7. Success toast: \"Report exported successfully\"\n\n**Error path:** If export fails → error toast: \"Export failed.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what we're building and user stories\n   - `artifacts/user-stories.md` — detailed user flows to design for\n   - `artifacts/scope.md` — what's in and out of scope\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Study the existing UI — look at existing components, design patterns, colors, typography, and spacing in the codebase\n5. Read `tailwind.config.*`, theme files, or design token files if they exist\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `frontend-design` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference during your work:\n\n- **design-system** — Design tokens, spacing scale, naming conventions, and visual language foundations\n- **component-spec** — Structured component specification template (props, states, variants, a11y)\n- **wireframe-preview** — Renderable React/HTML wireframe previews with annotation conventions\n- **accessibility-audit** — WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for components and pages\n- **responsive-layout** — Common responsive layout patterns, breakpoints, and container strategies\n- **color-typography** — Color palette structure, type scale, and contrast compliance guidance\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the spec and user stories. Know what the user needs to accomplish.\n2. **Audit** — Review existing UI patterns, component library, and design system in the codebase.\n3. **Design** — Create component specifications and user flows that fit the existing design system.\n4. **Specify** — Write detailed component specs with states, interactions, and responsive behavior.\n5. **Accessibility** — Verify the design meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n## What to Produce\n\n### User Flows\n- Step-by-step flows for each user story\n- Include happy path and key error paths\n- Note decision points and branching paths\n\n### Component Specifications\nFor each new or modified component:\n- **Purpose** — What does this component do?\n- **States** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty\n- **Content** — Labels, placeholder text, error messages\n- **Layout** — Dimensions, spacing, alignment\n- **Responsive** — Behavior at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints\n- **Interactions** — Click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation\n- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, roles, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader behavior\n\n### Design Tokens\nIf new design tokens are needed (colors, spacing, etc.), define them within the existing system.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match the existing design system.** Don't introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing that aren't in the current system. If no design system exists, establish minimal, consistent defaults.\n- **Design for all states.** Every component has loading, error, and empty states. Don't just design the happy path.\n- **Mobile first.** Design the mobile layout, then adapt for larger screens.\n- **Accessibility is required, not optional.** Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible. Every image needs alt text. Color alone must not convey information.\n- **Be specific about copy.** Don't write \"error message goes here.\" Write the actual error message: \"Unable to export report. Please try again.\"\n- **Don't create pixel-perfect mockups.** Write component specs that a developer can implement. React component descriptions with props, states, and behavior.\n\n## Output\n\n### `artifacts/ui-specs/` directory\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/user-flows.md`\n```markdown\n# User Flows\n\n## Flow 1: [Flow Name]\n1.

Button shows loading spinner, disabled state\n6. Download starts automatically\n7. Success toast: \"Report exported successfully\"\n\n**Error path:** If export fails → error toast: \"Export failed. Please try again.\" Button returns to default state.\n```\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/components.md`\n```markdown\n# Component Specifications\n\n## ExportButton\n**Purpose:** Triggers report export with format selection.\n\n**Props:**\n- `reportId: string` — the report to export\n- `disabled?: boolean` — disable when report is still loading\n\n**States:**\n| State | Appearance | Behavior |\n|-------|------------|----------|\n| Default | \"Export\" with download icon | Clickable |\n| Hover | Slightly darker background | Cursor pointer |\n| Loading | Spinner replaces icon, \"Exporting...\" | Disabled, not clickable |\n| Disabled | Grayed out | Not clickable, `aria-disabled=\"true\"` |\n\n**Accessibility:**\n- `aria-label=\"Export report as CSV or JSON\"`\n- Keyboard: Enter/Space activates\n- Loading state announced via `aria-live=\"polite\"`\n\n**Responsive:**\n- Desktop: Full button with text + icon\n- Mobile: Icon-only button with tooltip\n```\n\n#### `artifacts/component-specs.md`\nSummary of all component specs with cross-references.\n\n### `.agent-result.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"complete\",\n  \"summary\": \"Designed export flow with 2 new components.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Sidebar + Content\n\nThe most common app layout. Sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu on mobile.\n\n| Breakpoint | Sidebar         | Content              |\n|------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| < 1024px   | Hidden (hamburger toggle) | Full width    |\n| ≥ 1024px   | Fixed 256px left | Remaining width      |\n\n```\nMobile:            Desktop:\n┌──────────┐       ┌─────┬────────────┐\n│ ☰ Header │       │ Nav │  Header    │\n├──────────┤       │     ├────────────┤\n│          │       │     │            │\n│ Content  │       │     │  Content   │\n│          │       │     │            │\n└──────────┘       └─────┴────────────┘\n```\n\n### 2. Card Grid\n\nCards reflow from 1 column on mobile to multi-column on larger screens.\n\n| Breakpoint | Columns | Min card width |\n|------------|---------|----------------|\n| < 640px    | 1       | 100%           |\n| 640–1023px | 2       | ~280px         |\n| ≥ 1024px   | 3       | ~300px         |\n| ≥ 1280px   | 4       | ~280px         |\n\nUse `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr))` for automatic reflow.\n\n### 3. Data Table\n\nTables need special handling for small screens.\n\n| Breakpoint | Strategy                          |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|\n| < 768px    | Stack rows as cards OR horizontal scroll with sticky first column |\n| ≥ 768px    | Standard table layout             |\n\nPrefer card stacking for < 5 columns. Use horizontal scroll with a sticky first column for wide tables.\n\n### 4. Split View (List + Detail)\n\n| Breakpoint | Behavior                                |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| < 1024px   | List and detail as separate views (navigate between) |\n| ≥ 1024px   | Side-by-side: list 320px, detail fills remaining |\n\n### 5. Form Layout\n\n| Breakpoint | Strategy                          |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|\n| < 640px    | Single column, full-width inputs  |\n| ≥ 640px    | Two-column for related fields (first/last name) |\n| ≥ 1024px   | Sidebar labels (label left, input right) |\n\n### 6. Hero / Marketing Section\n\n| Breakpoint | Strategy                           |\n|------------|------------------------------------|\n| < 768px    | Stack: image below text, centered  |\n| ≥ 768px    | Side-by-side: text left, image right |\n\n## Container Strategy\n\nUse a centered max-width container for content:\n\n| Context    | Max Width | Padding          |\n|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Prose      | 680px     | 16px horizontal  |\n| App content| 1200px    | 16–32px          |\n| Full-bleed | 100%      | 0                |\n\n## Touch Target Sizes\n\n- Minimum tap target: 44x44px (WCAG) / 48x48px (Material)\n- Minimum spacing between targets: 8px\n- On mobile, increase button padding and link hit areas\n\n## Responsive Typography\n\n| Element    | Mobile   | Desktop  |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Body       | 16px     | 16px     |\n| H1         | 28px     | 36px     |\n| H2         | 22px     | 28px     |\n| H3         | 18px     | 22px     |\n| Small/Meta | 13px     | 14px     |\n\nUse `clamp()` for fluid scaling: `font-size: clamp(1.75rem, 1.5rem + 1vw, 2.25rem)`.\n\n## Specifying Responsive Behavior\n\nWhen writing component specs, always include a responsive table:\n\n```markdown\n## Responsive Behavior\n\n| Breakpoint | Changes                              |\n|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| < 640px    | Stack vertically, hide secondary actions |\n| 640–1023px | Two-column layout, show all actions  |\n| ≥ 1024px   | Three-column, inline filters         |\n```\n"}}

Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance.\n---\n\n# Accessibility Audit — WCAG 2.1 AA\n\nRun this checklist against every component spec or implementation. Each item must be marked Pass, Fail, or N/A with a note.\n\n## Audit Checklist\n\n### 1. Perceivable\n\n#### 1.1 Text Alternatives\n- [ ] All `<img>` elements have descriptive `alt` text (or `alt=\"\"` for decorative images)\n- [ ] Icon-only buttons have `aria-label` or visually hidden text\n- [ ] Complex images (charts, diagrams) have long descriptions\n\n#### 1.2 Color and Contrast\n- [ ] Text contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 against background (normal text)\n- [ ] Text contrast ratio ≥ 3:1 against background (large text ≥ 18px or bold ≥ 14px)\n- [ ] UI component contrast ratio ≥ 3:1 (borders, icons, focus indicators)\n- [ ] Color is not the only means of conveying information (add icons, patterns, or text)\n\n#### 1.3 Sensory Characteristics\n- [ ] Instructions don't rely solely on shape, size, location, or color (\"click the red button\")\n- [ ] Error states use both color AND icon/text to indicate the problem\n\n#### 1.4 Content Reflow\n- [ ] Content is usable at 320px viewport width without horizontal scrolling\n- [ ] Text can be resized to 200% without loss of content or functionality\n\n### 2. Operable\n\n#### 2.1 Keyboard Accessible\n- [ ] All interactive elements are reachable via Tab key\n- [ ] Tab order follows logical reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)\n- [ ] No keyboard traps — user can always Tab away from a component\n- [ ] Custom components support expected keys (Enter/Space for buttons, Arrow keys for menus)\n- [ ] Focus is visible — focus ring or outline is clearly visible on all interactive elements\n\n#### 2.2 Focus Management\n- [ ] When a modal opens, focus moves to the modal\n- [ ] When a modal closes, focus returns to the trigger element\n- [ ] When content is deleted, focus moves to a logical next element\n- [ ] Skip-to-content link is present on pages with navigation\n\n#### 2.3 Timing\n- [ ] No content auto-updates faster than the user can read it\n- [ ] Auto-playing carousels/animations have pause controls\n- [ ] Session timeouts warn users and offer extension\n\n#### 2.4 Navigation\n- [ ] Page has a descriptive `<title>`\n- [ ] Headings follow a logical hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skipped levels)\n- [ ] Links have descriptive text (not \"click here\" or \"read more\")\n- [ ] Breadcrumbs or other wayfinding is present for nested pages\n\n### 3. Understandable\n\n#### 3.1 Forms\n- [ ] Every input has a visible `<label>` (not just placeholder text)\n- [ ] Required fields are indicated (not just by color)\n- [ ] Error messages are specific and adjacent to the field (\"Email is required\" not \"Form has errors\")\n- [ ] Error messages are linked to fields via `aria-describedby`\n- [ ] Form submission errors preserve user input\n\n#### 3.2 Predictable Behavior\n- [ ] No unexpected context changes on focus or input\n- [ ] Navigation is consistent across pages\n- [ ] Similar components behave the same way throughout the app\n\n### 4. Robust\n\n#### 4.1 ARIA Usage\n- [ ] ARIA roles match component behavior (`role=\"dialog\"`, `role=\"alert\"`, etc.)\n- [ ] `aria-live` regions are used for dynamic content updates\n- [ ] `aria-expanded` is set on disclosure triggers (accordions, dropdowns)\n- [ ] `aria-hidden=\"true\"` is set on decorative/duplicate content\n- [ ] No redundant ARIA (don't add `role=\"button\"` to `<button>`)\n\n#### 4.2 Semantic HTML\n- [ ] Using native HTML elements where possible (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`)\n- [ ] Lists use `<ul>`/`<ol>`, not divs with bullets\n- [ ] Tables use `<table>` with `<th>` for headers and `scope` attributes\n- [ ] Landmark regions are present (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`)\n\n## Audit Report Format\n\n```markdown\n# Accessibility Audit: [Component/Page Name]\n\n**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 AA\n**Result:** Pass / Fail (N issues)\n\n## Issues Found\n\n### Issue 1: [Title]\n- **Criterion:** 1.2 Color and Contrast\n- **Severity:** Critical / Major / Minor\n- **Element:** `.card-title` text on `.card-bg`\n- **Current:** Contrast ratio 2.8:1\n- **Required:** 4.5:1\n- **Fix:** Change text color from `#9ca3af` to `#4b5563`\n\n## Passed Checks\n- [List checks that passed]\n```\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

User opens Run Monitor and selects project/run from the top global controls.\\n2. Run header strip loads with run ID, project, current status, start time, elapsed time, and primary actions (`Pause auto-refresh`, `Jump to active step`, `Open artifacts`).\\n3. Phase progress bar renders directly under header with ordered phases (`Plan`, `Execute`, `Validate`, `Finalize`) and current phase highlighted.\\n4. Main split shows timeline on the left and active step/decision context on the right.\\n5. Timeline auto-scrolls to the newest event unless user manually scrolls up (auto-follow pauses).\\n6. Selecting any timeline item updates active context panel with step details, decision reason, impacted files, and agent output summary.\\n7. Secondary panel (artifacts/logs) appears as a right rail tabset; user can switch between `Artifacts`, `Logs`, and `Result JSON` without losing main selection.\\n\\n**Error path:** If run data fails to load, replace main split with inline error state: \\\"Unable to load this run. Check monitor server connectivity and try again.\\\" Keep header strip visible with `Retry` button.\\n\\n## Flow 2: Review a decision and related artifacts\\n1. User clicks a `Decision` event in timeline.\\n2. Active context panel anchors to `Decision context` section and shows decision prompt, selected option, confidence, and rationale.\\n3. User opens `Artifacts` tab in secondary panel.\\n4. Artifact list filters to files touched by selected decision, sorted newest-first.\\n5.

User opens Run Monitor on a phone (<768px).\\n2. Header strip collapses to two rows: run identity/status row and compact actions row.\\n3. Phase progress becomes horizontally scrollable chip-track with current phase pinned first.\\n4. Main content defaults to timeline list; tapping an event opens active context in a bottom drawer.\\n5. Secondary content is moved into an accordion below timeline (`Artifacts`, `Logs`, `Result JSON`), single-section-open behavior.\\n6. If user taps `Open full logs`, logs expand into full-height drawer with close control and preserved scroll position.\\n7. Closing drawer returns focus to trigger event row/accordion button.\\n\\n**Error path:** If log fetch fails in drawer, show inline error: \\\"Unable to fetch logs. Pull to retry or tap Refresh.\\\" Keep drawer open for retry.\\n\\n## Flow 4: Keyboard/screen reader interaction\\n1. User tabs through header actions, then phase progress landmarks, then timeline.\\n2. Timeline rows are keyboard-selectable (`Enter`/`Space`) and announce type + timestamp + status.\\n3. Selecting a row moves virtual cursor target to active context heading (`aria-live=\\\"polite\\\"` summary announcement only).\\n4. Opening mobile drawer traps focus within drawer until dismissed with `Escape` or close button.\\n\\n**Error path:** If focus target is missing (stale selection), return focus to timeline list container and announce \\\"Selection expired; choose another event.\\\"\\nEOF\"}","call_id":"call_B0oMFvlm8WgJxqFCyxacgIv3"}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what we're building and user stories\n   - `artifacts/user-stories.md` — detailed user flows to design for\n   - `artifacts/scope.md` — what's in and out of scope\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Study the existing UI — look at existing components, design patterns, colors, typography, and spacing in the codebase\n5. Read `tailwind.config.*`, theme files, or design token files if they exist\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `frontend-design` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference during your work:\n\n- **design-system** — Design tokens, spacing scale, naming conventions, and visual language foundations\n- **component-spec** — Structured component specification template (props, states, variants, a11y)\n- **wireframe-preview** — Renderable React/HTML wireframe previews with annotation conventions\n- **accessibility-audit** — WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for components and pages\n- **responsive-layout** — Common responsive layout patterns, breakpoints, and container strategies\n- **color-typography** — Color palette structure, type scale, and contrast compliance guidance\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the spec and user stories. Know what the user needs to accomplish.\n2. **Audit** — Review existing UI patterns, component library, and design system in the codebase.\n3. **Design** — Create component specifications and user flows that fit the existing design system.\n4. **Specify** — Write detailed component specs with states, interactions, and responsive behavior.\n5. **Accessibility** — Verify the design meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n## What to Produce\n\n### User Flows\n- Step-by-step flows for each user story\n- Include happy path and key error paths\n- Note decision points and branching paths\n\n### Component Specifications\nFor each new or modified component:\n- **Purpose** — What does this component do?\n- **States** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty\n- **Content** — Labels, placeholder text, error messages\n- **Layout** — Dimensions, spacing, alignment\n- **Responsive** — Behavior at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints\n- **Interactions** — Click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation\n- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, roles, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader behavior\n\n### Design Tokens\nIf new design tokens are needed (colors, spacing, etc.), define them within the existing system.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match the existing design system.** Don't introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing that aren't in the current system. If no design system exists, establish minimal, consistent defaults.\n- **Design for all states.** Every component has loading, error, and empty states. Don't just design the happy path.\n- **Mobile first.** Design the mobile layout, then adapt for larger screens.\n- **Accessibility is required, not optional.** Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible. Every image needs alt text. Color alone must not convey information.\n- **Be specific about copy.** Don't write \"error message goes here.\" Write the actual error message: \"Unable to export report. Please try again.\"\n- **Don't create pixel-perfect mockups.** Write component specs that a developer can implement. React component descriptions with props, states, and behavior.\n\n## Output\n\n### `artifacts/ui-specs/` directory\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/user-flows.md`\n```markdown\n# User Flows\n\n## Flow 1: [Flow Name]\n1.

(file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what we're building and user stories\n   - `artifacts/user-stories.md` — detailed user flows to design for\n   - `artifacts/scope.md` — what's in and out of scope\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Study the existing UI — look at existing components, design patterns, colors, typography, and spacing in the codebase\n5. Read `tailwind.config.*`, theme files, or design token files if they exist\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `frontend-design` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference during your work:\n\n- **design-system** — Design tokens, spacing scale, naming conventions, and visual language foundations\n- **component-spec** — Structured component specification template (props, states, variants, a11y)\n- **wireframe-preview** — Renderable React/HTML wireframe previews with annotation conventions\n- **accessibility-audit** — WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for components and pages\n- **responsive-layout** — Common responsive layout patterns, breakpoints, and container strategies\n- **color-typography** — Color palette structure, type scale, and contrast compliance guidance\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the spec and user stories. Know what the user needs to accomplish.\n2. **Audit** — Review existing UI patterns, component library, and design system in the codebase.\n3. **Design** — Create component specifications and user flows that fit the existing design system.\n4. **Specify** — Write detailed component specs with states, interactions, and responsive behavior.\n5. **Accessibility** — Verify the design meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n## What to Produce\n\n### User Flows\n- Step-by-step flows for each user story\n- Include happy path and key error paths\n- Note decision points and branching paths\n\n### Component Specifications\nFor each new or modified component:\n- **Purpose** — What does this component do?\n- **States** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty\n- **Content** — Labels, placeholder text, error messages\n- **Layout** — Dimensions, spacing, alignment\n- **Responsive** — Behavior at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints\n- **Interactions** — Click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation\n- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, roles, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader behavior\n\n### Design Tokens\nIf new design tokens are needed (colors, spacing, etc.), define them within the existing system.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match the existing design system.** Don't introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing that aren't in the current system. If no design system exists, establish minimal, consistent defaults.\n- **Design for all states.** Every component has loading, error, and empty states. Don't just design the happy path.\n- **Mobile first.** Design the mobile layout, then adapt for larger screens.\n- **Accessibility is required, not optional.** Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible. Every image needs alt text. Color alone must not convey information.\n- **Be specific about copy.** Don't write \"error message goes here.\" Write the actual error message: \"Unable to export report. Please try again.\"\n- **Don't create pixel-perfect mockups.** Write component specs that a developer can implement. React component descriptions with props, states, and behavior.\n\n## Output\n\n### `artifacts/ui-specs/` directory\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/user-flows.md`\n```markdown\n# User Flows\n\n## Flow 1: [Flow Name]\n1.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what we're building and user stories\n   - `artifacts/user-stories.md` — detailed user flows to design for\n   - `artifacts/scope.md` — what's in and out of scope\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Study the existing UI — look at existing components, design patterns, colors, typography, and spacing in the codebase\n5. Read `tailwind.config.*`, theme files, or design token files if they exist\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `frontend-design` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference during your work:\n\n- **design-system** — Design tokens, spacing scale, naming conventions, and visual language foundations\n- **component-spec** — Structured component specification template (props, states, variants, a11y)\n- **wireframe-preview** — Renderable React/HTML wireframe previews with annotation conventions\n- **accessibility-audit** — WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for components and pages\n- **responsive-layout** — Common responsive layout patterns, breakpoints, and container strategies\n- **color-typography** — Color palette structure, type scale, and contrast compliance guidance\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the spec and user stories. Know what the user needs to accomplish.\n2. **Audit** — Review existing UI patterns, component library, and design system in the codebase.\n3. **Design** — Create component specifications and user flows that fit the existing design system.\n4. **Specify** — Write detailed component specs with states, interactions, and responsive behavior.\n5. **Accessibility** — Verify the design meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n## What to Produce\n\n### User Flows\n- Step-by-step flows for each user story\n- Include happy path and key error paths\n- Note decision points and branching paths\n\n### Component Specifications\nFor each new or modified component:\n- **Purpose** — What does this component do?\n- **States** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty\n- **Content** — Labels, placeholder text, error messages\n- **Layout** — Dimensions, spacing, alignment\n- **Responsive** — Behavior at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints\n- **Interactions** — Click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation\n- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, roles, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader behavior\n\n### Design Tokens\nIf new design tokens are needed (colors, spacing, etc.), define them within the existing system.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match the existing design system.** Don't introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing that aren't in the current system. If no design system exists, establish minimal, consistent defaults.\n- **Design for all states.** Every component has loading, error, and empty states. Don't just design the happy path.\n- **Mobile first.** Design the mobile layout, then adapt for larger screens.\n- **Accessibility is required, not optional.** Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible. Every image needs alt text. Color alone must not convey information.\n- **Be specific about copy.** Don't write \"error message goes here.\" Write the actual error message: \"Unable to export report. Please try again.\"\n- **Don't create pixel-perfect mockups.** Write component specs that a developer can implement. React component descriptions with props, states, and behavior.\n\n## Output\n\n### `artifacts/ui-specs/` directory\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/user-flows.md`\n```markdown\n# User Flows\n\n## Flow 1: [Flow Name]\n1. User navigates to Reports page\n2. User clicks \"Export\" button on a report row\n3. Modal appears with format options (CSV, JSON)\n4. User selects format and clicks \"Download\"\n5. Button shows loading spinner, disabled state\n6. Download starts automatically\n7. Success toast: \"Report exported successfully\"\n\n**Error path:** If export fails → error toast: \"Export failed. Please try again.\" Button returns to default state.\n```\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/components.md`\n```markdown\n# Component Specifications\n\n## ExportButton\n**Purpose:** Triggers report export with format selection.\n\n**Props:**\n- `reportId: string` — the report to export\n- `disabled?: boolean` — disable when report is still loading\n\n**States:**\n| State | Appearance | Behavior |\n|-------|------------|----------|\n| Default | \"Export\" with download icon | Clickable |\n| Hover | Slightly darker background | Cursor pointer |\n| Loading | Spinner replaces icon, \"Exporting...\" | Disabled, not clickable |\n| Disabled | Grayed out | Not clickable, `aria-disabled=\"true\"` |\n\n**Accessibility:**\n- `aria-label=\"Export report as CSV or JSON\"`\n- Keyboard: Enter/Space activates\n- Loading state announced via `aria-live=\"polite\"`\n\n**Responsive:**\n- Desktop: Full button with text + icon\n- Mobile: Icon-only button with tooltip\n```\n\n#### `artifacts/component-specs.md`\nSummary of all component specs with cross-references.\n\n### `.agent-result.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"complete\",\n  \"summary\": \"Designed export flow with 2 new components.

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what we're building and user stories\n   - `artifacts/user-stories.md` — detailed user flows to design for\n   - `artifacts/scope.md` — what's in and out of scope\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Study the existing UI — look at existing components, design patterns, colors, typography, and spacing in the codebase\n5. Read `tailwind.config.*`, theme files, or design token files if they exist\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `frontend-design` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference during your work:\n\n- **design-system** — Design tokens, spacing scale, naming conventions, and visual language foundations\n- **component-spec** — Structured component specification template (props, states, variants, a11y)\n- **wireframe-preview** — Renderable React/HTML wireframe previews with annotation conventions\n- **accessibility-audit** — WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for components and pages\n- **responsive-layout** — Common responsive layout patterns, breakpoints, and container strategies\n- **color-typography** — Color palette structure, type scale, and contrast compliance guidance\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the spec and user stories. Know what the user needs to accomplish.\n2. **Audit** — Review existing UI patterns, component library, and design system in the codebase.\n3. **Design** — Create component specifications and user flows that fit the existing design system.\n4. **Specify** — Write detailed component specs with states, interactions, and responsive behavior.\n5. **Accessibility** — Verify the design meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n## What to Produce\n\n### User Flows\n- Step-by-step flows for each user story\n- Include happy path and key error paths\n- Note decision points and branching paths\n\n### Component Specifications\nFor each new or modified component:\n- **Purpose** — What does this component do?\n- **States** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty\n- **Content** — Labels, placeholder text, error messages\n- **Layout** — Dimensions, spacing, alignment\n- **Responsive** — Behavior at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints\n- **Interactions** — Click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation\n- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, roles, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader behavior\n\n### Design Tokens\nIf new design tokens are needed (colors, spacing, etc.), define them within the existing system.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match the existing design system.** Don't introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing that aren't in the current system. If no design system exists, establish minimal, consistent defaults.\n- **Design for all states.** Every component has loading, error, and empty states. Don't just design the happy path.\n- **Mobile first.** Design the mobile layout, then adapt for larger screens.\n- **Accessibility is required, not optional.** Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible. Every image needs alt text. Color alone must not convey information.\n- **Be specific about copy.** Don't write \"error message goes here.\" Write the actual error message: \"Unable to export report. Please try again.\"\n- **Don't create pixel-perfect mockups.** Write component specs that a developer can implement. React component descriptions with props, states, and behavior.\n\n## Output\n\n### `artifacts/ui-specs/` directory\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/user-flows.md`\n```markdown\n# User Flows\n\n## Flow 1: [Flow Name]\n1. User navigates to Reports page\n2. User clicks \"Export\" button on a report row\n3. Modal appears with format options (CSV, JSON)\n4. User selects format and clicks \"Download\"\n5. Button shows loading spinner, disabled state\n6. Download starts automatically\n7. Success toast: \"Report exported successfully\"\n\n**Error path:** If export fails → error toast: \"Export failed. Please try again.\" Button returns to default state.\n```\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/components.md`\n```markdown\n# Component Specifications\n\n## ExportButton\n**Purpose:** Triggers report export with format selection.\n\n**Props:**\n- `reportId: string` — the report to export\n- `disabled?: boolean` — disable when report is still loading\n\n**States:**\n| State | Appearance | Behavior |\n|-------|------------|----------|\n| Default | \"Export\" with download icon | Clickable |\n| Hover | Slightly darker background | Cursor pointer |\n| Loading | Spinner replaces icon, \"Exporting...\" | Disabled, not clickable |\n| Disabled | Grayed out | Not clickable, `aria-disabled=\"true\"` |\n\n**Accessibility:**\n- `aria-label=\"Export report as CSV or JSON\"`\n- Keyboard: Enter/Space activates\n- Loading state announced via `aria-live=\"polite\"`\n\n**Responsive:**\n- Desktop: Full button with text + icon\n- Mobile: Icon-only button with tooltip\n```\n\n#### `artifacts/component-specs.md`\nSummary of all component specs with cross-references.\n\n### `.agent-result.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"complete\",\n  \"summary\": \"Designed export flow with 2 new components.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read `tailwind.config.*`, theme files, or design token files if they exist\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `frontend-design` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference during your work:\n\n- **design-system** — Design tokens, spacing scale, naming conventions, and visual language foundations\n- **component-spec** — Structured component specification template (props, states, variants, a11y)\n- **wireframe-preview** — Renderable React/HTML wireframe previews with annotation conventions\n- **accessibility-audit** — WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for components and pages\n- **responsive-layout** — Common responsive layout patterns, breakpoints, and container strategies\n- **color-typography** — Color palette structure, type scale, and contrast compliance guidance\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the spec and user stories. Know what the user needs to accomplish.\n2. **Audit** — Review existing UI patterns, component library, and design system in the codebase.\n3. **Design** — Create component specifications and user flows that fit the existing design system.\n4. **Specify** — Write detailed component specs with states, interactions, and responsive behavior.\n5. **Accessibility** — Verify the design meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n## What to Produce\n\n### User Flows\n- Step-by-step flows for each user story\n- Include happy path and key error paths\n- Note decision points and branching paths\n\n### Component Specifications\nFor each new or modified component:\n- **Purpose** — What does this component do?\n- **States** — Default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty\n- **Content** — Labels, placeholder text, error messages\n- **Layout** — Dimensions, spacing, alignment\n- **Responsive** — Behavior at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints\n- **Interactions** — Click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation\n- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, roles, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader behavior\n\n### Design Tokens\nIf new design tokens are needed (colors, spacing, etc.), define them within the existing system.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match the existing design system.** Don't introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing that aren't in the current system. If no design system exists, establish minimal, consistent defaults.\n- **Design for all states.** Every component has loading, error, and empty states. Don't just design the happy path.\n- **Mobile first.** Design the mobile layout, then adapt for larger screens.\n- **Accessibility is required, not optional.** Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible. Every image needs alt text. Color alone must not convey information.\n- **Be specific about copy.** Don't write \"error message goes here.\" Write the actual error message: \"Unable to export report. Please try again.\"\n- **Don't create pixel-perfect mockups.** Write component specs that a developer can implement. React component descriptions with props, states, and behavior.\n\n## Output\n\n### `artifacts/ui-specs/` directory\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/user-flows.md`\n```markdown\n# User Flows\n\n## Flow 1: [Flow Name]\n1. User navigates to Reports page\n2. User clicks \"Export\" button on a report row\n3. Modal appears with format options (CSV, JSON)\n4. User selects format and clicks \"Download\"\n5. Button shows loading spinner, disabled state\n6. Download starts automatically\n7. Success toast: \"Report exported successfully\"\n\n**Error path:** If export fails → error toast: \"Export failed. Please try again.\" Button returns to default state.\n```\n\n#### `artifacts/ui-specs/components.md`\n```markdown\n# Component Specifications\n\n## ExportButton\n**Purpose:** Triggers report export with format selection.\n\n**Props:**\n- `reportId: string` — the report to export\n- `disabled?: boolean` — disable when report is still loading\n\n**States:**\n| State | Appearance | Behavior |\n|-------|------------|----------|\n| Default | \"Export\" with download icon | Clickable |\n| Hover | Slightly darker background | Cursor pointer |\n| Loading | Spinner replaces icon, \"Exporting...\" | Disabled, not clickable |\n| Disabled | Grayed out | Not clickable, `aria-disabled=\"true\"` |\n\n**Accessibility:**\n- `aria-label=\"Export report as CSV or JSON\"`\n- Keyboard: Enter/Space activates\n- Loading state announced via `aria-live=\"polite\"`\n\n**Responsive:**\n- Desktop: Full button with text + icon\n- Mobile: Icon-only button with tooltip\n```\n\n#### `artifacts/component-specs.md`\nSummary of all component specs with cross-references.\n\n### `.agent-result.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"complete\",\n  \"summary\": \"Designed export flow with 2 new components.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance.

Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
