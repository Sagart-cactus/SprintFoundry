You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration comes through as direct, factual statements. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nYou avoid cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance, or any kind of fluff. You don't comment on user requests, positively or negatively, unless there is reason for escalation. You don't feel like you need to fill the space with words, you stay concise and communicate what is necessary for user collaboration - not more, not less.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You have 2 ways of communicating with the users:\n- Share intermediary updates in `commentary` channel. \n- After you have completed all your work, send a message to the `final` channel.\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly.\n\n## Autonomy and persistence\nPersist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.\n\nUnless the user explicitly asks for a plan, asks a question about the code, is brainstorming potential solutions, or some other intent that makes it clear that code should not be written, assume the user wants you to make code changes or run tools to solve the user's problem. In these cases, it's bad to output your proposed solution in a message, you should go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.\n\n## Formatting rules\n\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis or em dashes unless explicitly instructed.\n\n## Final answer instructions\n\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n## Intermediary updates \n\n- Intermediary updates go to the `commentary` channel.\n- User updates are short updates while you are working, they are NOT final answers.\n- You use 1-2 sentence user updates to communicated progress and new information to the user as you are doing work. \n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- You provide user updates frequently, every 20s.\n- Before exploring or doing substantial work, you start with a user update acknowledging the request and explaining your first step. You should include your understanding of the user request and explain what you will do. Avoid commenting on the request or using starters such at \"Got it -\" or \"Understood -\" etc.\n- When exploring, e.g. searching, reading files you provide user updates as you go, every 20s, explaining what context you are gathering and what you've learned. Vary your sentence structure when providing these updates to avoid sounding repetitive - in particular, don't start each sentence the same way.\n- After you have sufficient context, and the work is substantial you provide a longer plan (this is the only user update that may be longer than 2 sentences and can contain formatting).\n- Before performing file edits of any kind, you provide updates explaining what edits you are making.\n- As you are thinking, you very frequently provide updates even if not taking any actions, informing the user of your progress. You interrupt your thinking and send multiple updates in a row if thinking for more than 100 words.\n- Tone of your updates MUST match your personality.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"5f2873b180e895760b1988fca94da450127dfacc","branch":"feat/prompt-1771004861239-redesign-the-run-monitor-with-strict-adherence-to-","repository_url":"git@github.com:Sagart-cactus/SprintFoundry.git"}}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what to build and acceptance criteria\n   - `artifacts/architecture.md` — system design, data models, API contracts\n   - `artifacts/api-contracts.yaml` — expected API shapes\n   - `artifacts/ui-specs/` — component specs and wireframes\n   - `artifacts/handoff/` — notes from previous agents\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Read the existing codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and tech stack\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `js-nextjs` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference for Next.js projects:\n\n- **nextjs-app-router** — File conventions, routing patterns, layouts, metadata API, loading/error boundaries\n- **react-patterns** — Server vs Client Components, Suspense, data fetching, composition strategies\n- **nextjs-config** — next.config.mjs options, environment variables, middleware patterns\n- **nextjs-testing** — Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright setup and patterns\n- **nextjs-performance** — ISR, streaming, image optimization, caching, bundle analysis\n- **api-routes** — Route Handlers, input validation, error handling, auth patterns\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the task, spec, architecture docs, and relevant source code. Know what you're building before writing any code.\n2. **Plan** — Identify the files to create/modify. Think through the approach before coding.\n3. **Implement** — Write the code. Follow existing patterns and conventions.\n4. **Self-test** — Run the code. Fix errors. Make sure it actually works.\n5. **Handoff** — Write a clear handoff doc for the QA agent.\n\n## Code Standards\n\n- Follow the existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure\n- Use TypeScript with strict types. Avoid `any`.\n- Write small, focused functions. Each function does one thing.\n- Handle errors at API boundaries. Use early returns for guard clauses.\n- Name variables and functions descriptively. The code should read like prose.\n- Don't leave TODO comments — either implement it or note it in the handoff doc.\n- Don't add dead code, commented-out code, or unused imports.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match existing patterns.** If the codebase uses a certain ORM, router, or state library, use the same one. Don't introduce new dependencies without a strong reason.\n- **Don't over-engineer.** Implement what the spec asks for. No premature abstractions, no \"nice-to-haves\" the spec didn't mention.\n- **Run the code.** Don't just write it — execute it and verify it works. If tests exist, run them.\n- **Fix what you break.** If existing tests fail after your changes, fix them. Check with `npm test` or the project's test command.\n- **Respect architecture decisions.** If an architecture doc or ADR exists, follow it. Don't deviate without documenting why.\n- **Database migrations** must be reversible.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what to build and acceptance criteria\n   - `artifacts/architecture.md` — system design, data models, API contracts\n   - `artifacts/api-contracts.yaml` — expected API shapes\n   - `artifacts/ui-specs/` — component specs and wireframes\n   - `artifacts/handoff/` — notes from previous agents\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Read the existing codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and tech stack\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `js-nextjs` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference for Next.js projects:\n\n- **nextjs-app-router** — File conventions, routing patterns, layouts, metadata API, loading/error boundaries\n- **react-patterns** — Server vs Client Components, Suspense, data fetching, composition strategies\n- **nextjs-config** — next.config.mjs options, environment variables, middleware patterns\n- **nextjs-testing** — Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright setup and patterns\n- **nextjs-performance** — ISR, streaming, image optimization, caching, bundle analysis\n- **api-routes** — Route Handlers, input validation, error handling, auth patterns\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the task, spec, architecture docs, and relevant source code. Know what you're building before writing any code.\n2. **Plan** — Identify the files to create/modify. Think through the approach before coding.\n3. **Implement** — Write the code. Follow existing patterns and conventions.\n4. **Self-test** — Run the code. Fix errors. Make sure it actually works.\n5. **Handoff** — Write a clear handoff doc for the QA agent.\n\n## Code Standards\n\n- Follow the existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure\n- Use TypeScript with strict types. Avoid `any`.\n- Write small, focused functions. Each function does one thing.\n- Handle errors at API boundaries. Use early returns for guard clauses.\n- Name variables and functions descriptively. The code should read like prose.\n- Don't leave TODO comments — either implement it or note it in the handoff doc.\n- Don't add dead code, commented-out code, or unused imports.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match existing patterns.** If the codebase uses a certain ORM, router, or state library, use the same one. Don't introduce new dependencies without a strong reason.\n- **Don't over-engineer.** Implement what the spec asks for. No premature abstractions, no \"nice-to-haves\" the spec didn't mention.\n- **Run the code.** Don't just write it — execute it and verify it works. If tests exist, run them.\n- **Fix what you break.** If existing tests fail after your changes, fix them. Check with `npm test` or the project's test command.\n- **Respect architecture decisions.** If an architecture doc or ADR exists, follow it.

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what to build and acceptance criteria\n   - `artifacts/architecture.md` — system design, data models, API contracts\n   - `artifacts/api-contracts.yaml` — expected API shapes\n   - `artifacts/ui-specs/` — component specs and wireframes\n   - `artifacts/handoff/` — notes from previous agents\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Read the existing codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and tech stack\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `js-nextjs` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference for Next.js projects:\n\n- **nextjs-app-router** — File conventions, routing patterns, layouts, metadata API, loading/error boundaries\n- **react-patterns** — Server vs Client Components, Suspense, data fetching, composition strategies\n- **nextjs-config** — next.config.mjs options, environment variables, middleware patterns\n- **nextjs-testing** — Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright setup and patterns\n- **nextjs-performance** — ISR, streaming, image optimization, caching, bundle analysis\n- **api-routes** — Route Handlers, input validation, error handling, auth patterns\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the task, spec, architecture docs, and relevant source code. Know what you're building before writing any code.\n2. **Plan** — Identify the files to create/modify. Think through the approach before coding.\n3. **Implement** — Write the code. Follow existing patterns and conventions.\n4. **Self-test** — Run the code. Fix errors. Make sure it actually works.\n5. **Handoff** — Write a clear handoff doc for the QA agent.\n\n## Code Standards\n\n- Follow the existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure\n- Use TypeScript with strict types. Avoid `any`.\n- Write small, focused functions. Each function does one thing.\n- Handle errors at API boundaries. Use early returns for guard clauses.\n- Name variables and functions descriptively. The code should read like prose.\n- Don't leave TODO comments — either implement it or note it in the handoff doc.\n- Don't add dead code, commented-out code, or unused imports.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match existing patterns.** If the codebase uses a certain ORM, router, or state library, use the same one. Don't introduce new dependencies without a strong reason.\n- **Don't over-engineer.** Implement what the spec asks for. No premature abstractions, no \"nice-to-haves\" the spec didn't mention.\n- **Run the code.** Don't just write it — execute it and verify it works. If tests exist, run them.\n- **Fix what you break.** If existing tests fail after your changes, fix them. Check with `npm test` or the project's test command.\n- **Respect architecture decisions.** If an architecture doc or ADR exists, follow it. Don't deviate without documenting why.\n- **Database migrations** must be reversible. Include both up and down.\n\n## Output\n\n### Source Code\nWrite/modify source code in the existing project structure.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Start monitor server as usual for your environment.\n2. Open the monitor UI and select a project/run.\n3. Verify timeline rows show event summary first and `Show payload` toggles open/close payload JSON.\n4. Scroll timeline up; verify follow mode pauses, notice appears, and `Jump to latest` returns to live tail.\n5. Click `Load older events`; verify older rows prepend without jumping away from current reading position.\n6. Select timeline rows; verify context pane updates with selected event payload and active step/next action cards.\n7. Toggle `Pause updates`; wait for interval window; verify data does not refresh automatically.\n8. Click `Sync now`; verify one manual refresh occurs while still paused.\n9. Switch secondary tabs (`Artifacts`, `Logs`, `Result JSON`) and verify data appears in each panel.\n10. Validate keyboard basics: tab to timeline buttons, open payload toggles, and use skip link to jump to timeline.\n\n## Environment Setup\n- No new env vars added.\n- No new dependencies added.\n- No migrations.\n\n## Notes\n- Verification constraints in this sandbox:\n- `npm test` failed because `vitest` package is unavailable in this runtime (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).\n- Local HTTP listen smoke test was blocked by sandbox (`listen EPERM`), so browser-level runtime validation must be done in QA/local dev.\n- JS syntax checks passed for `monitor/public/app.js` and `monitor/server.mjs`.\n"}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what to build and acceptance criteria\n   - `artifacts/architecture.md` — system design, data models, API contracts\n   - `artifacts/api-contracts.yaml` — expected API shapes\n   - `artifacts/ui-specs/` — component specs and wireframes\n   - `artifacts/handoff/` — notes from previous agents\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Read the existing codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and tech stack\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `js-nextjs` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference for Next.js projects:\n\n- **nextjs-app-router** — File conventions, routing patterns, layouts, metadata API, loading/error boundaries\n- **react-patterns** — Server vs Client Components, Suspense, data fetching, composition strategies\n- **nextjs-config** — next.config.mjs options, environment variables, middleware patterns\n- **nextjs-testing** — Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright setup and patterns\n- **nextjs-performance** — ISR, streaming, image optimization, caching, bundle analysis\n- **api-routes** — Route Handlers, input validation, error handling, auth patterns\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the task, spec, architecture docs, and relevant source code. Know what you're building before writing any code.\n2. **Plan** — Identify the files to create/modify. Think through the approach before coding.\n3. **Implement** — Write the code. Follow existing patterns and conventions.\n4. **Self-test** — Run the code. Fix errors. Make sure it actually works.\n5. **Handoff** — Write a clear handoff doc for the QA agent.\n\n## Code Standards\n\n- Follow the existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure\n- Use TypeScript with strict types. Avoid `any`.\n- Write small, focused functions. Each function does one thing.\n- Handle errors at API boundaries. Use early returns for guard clauses.\n- Name variables and functions descriptively. The code should read like prose.\n- Don't leave TODO comments — either implement it or note it in the handoff doc.\n- Don't add dead code, commented-out code, or unused imports.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match existing patterns.** If the codebase uses a certain ORM, router, or state library, use the same one. Don't introduce new dependencies without a strong reason.\n- **Don't over-engineer.** Implement what the spec asks for. No premature abstractions, no \"nice-to-haves\" the spec didn't mention.\n- **Run the code.** Don't just write it — execute it and verify it works. If tests exist, run them.\n- **Fix what you break.** If existing tests fail after your changes, fix them. Check with `npm test` or the project's test command.\n- **Respect architecture decisions.** If an architecture doc or ADR exists, follow it. Don't deviate without documenting why.\n- **Database migrations** must be reversible. Include both up and down.\n\n## Output\n\n### Source Code\nWrite/modify source code in the existing project structure. Follow the project's directory conventions.\n\n### `artifacts/handoff/dev-to-qa.md`\n```markdown\n# Developer → QA Handoff\n\n## What Changed\n- List every file created or modified\n- Describe what each change does\n\n## How to Test\n- Steps to run the feature locally\n- Expected behavior for happy path\n- Known edge cases to test\n\n## Environment Setup\n- Any new env vars needed\n- Any new dependencies (`npm install` should handle it)\n- Database migrations to run (if any)\n\n## Notes\n- Anything the QA agent should know\n- Design decisions that might affect testing\n- Areas of uncertainty or risk\n```\n\n### `.agent-result.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"complete\",\n  \"summary\": \"Implemented CSV export feature with streaming for large datasets\",\n  \"artifacts_created\": [\"src/api/export.ts\", \"src/components/ExportButton.tsx\"],\n  \"artifacts_modified\": [\"src/api/routes.ts\", \"src/types/report.ts\"],\n  \"issues\": [],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"files_created\": 2,\n    \"files_modified\": 2,\n    \"lines_added\": 245,\n    \"lines_removed\": 12\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf blocked or unable to complete:\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"blocked\",\n  \"summary\": \"Cannot implement — missing database schema for reports table\",\n  \"artifacts_created\": [],\n  \"artifacts_modified\": [],\n  \"issues\": [\n    \"No reports table exists in the database.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what to build and acceptance criteria\n   - `artifacts/architecture.md` — system design, data models, API contracts\n   - `artifacts/api-contracts.yaml` — expected API shapes\n   - `artifacts/ui-specs/` — component specs and wireframes\n   - `artifacts/handoff/` — notes from previous agents\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Read the existing codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and tech stack\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `js-nextjs` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference for Next.js projects:\n\n- **nextjs-app-router** — File conventions, routing patterns, layouts, metadata API, loading/error boundaries\n- **react-patterns** — Server vs Client Components, Suspense, data fetching, composition strategies\n- **nextjs-config** — next.config.mjs options, environment variables, middleware patterns\n- **nextjs-testing** — Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright setup and patterns\n- **nextjs-performance** — ISR, streaming, image optimization, caching, bundle analysis\n- **api-routes** — Route Handlers, input validation, error handling, auth patterns\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the task, spec, architecture docs, and relevant source code. Know what you're building before writing any code.\n2. **Plan** — Identify the files to create/modify. Think through the approach before coding.\n3. **Implement** — Write the code. Follow existing patterns and conventions.\n4. **Self-test** — Run the code. Fix errors. Make sure it actually works.\n5. **Handoff** — Write a clear handoff doc for the QA agent.\n\n## Code Standards\n\n- Follow the existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure\n- Use TypeScript with strict types. Avoid `any`.\n- Write small, focused functions. Each function does one thing.\n- Handle errors at API boundaries. Use early returns for guard clauses.\n- Name variables and functions descriptively. The code should read like prose.\n- Don't leave TODO comments — either implement it or note it in the handoff doc.\n- Don't add dead code, commented-out code, or unused imports.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match existing patterns.** If the codebase uses a certain ORM, router, or state library, use the same one. Don't introduce new dependencies without a strong reason.\n- **Don't over-engineer.** Implement what the spec asks for. No premature abstractions, no \"nice-to-haves\" the spec didn't mention.\n- **Run the code.** Don't just write it — execute it and verify it works. If tests exist, run them.\n- **Fix what you break.** If existing tests fail after your changes, fix them. Check with `npm test` or the project's test command.\n- **Respect architecture decisions.** If an architecture doc or ADR exists, follow it. Don't deviate without documenting why.\n- **Database migrations** must be reversible. Include both up and down.\n\n## Output\n\n### Source Code\nWrite/modify source code in the existing project structure.

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Sidebar + Content\n\nThe most common app layout. Sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu on mobile.\n\n| Breakpoint | Sidebar         | Content              |\n|------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| < 1024px   | Hidden (hamburger toggle) | Full width    |\n| ≥ 1024px   | Fixed 256px left | Remaining width      |\n\n```\nMobile:            Desktop:\n┌──────────┐       ┌─────┬────────────┐\n│ ☰ Header │       │ Nav │  Header    │\n├──────────┤       │     ├────────────┤\n│          │       │     │            │\n│ Content  │       │     │  Content   │\n│          │       │     │            │\n└──────────┘       └─────┴────────────┘\n```\n\n### 2. Card Grid\n\nCards reflow from 1 column on mobile to multi-column on larger screens.\n\n| Breakpoint | Columns | Min card width |\n|------------|---------|----------------|\n| < 640px    | 1       | 100%           |\n| 640–1023px | 2       | ~280px         |\n| ≥ 1024px   | 3       | ~300px         |\n| ≥ 1280px   | 4       | ~280px         |\n\nUse `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr))` for automatic reflow.\n\n### 3. Data Table\n\nTables need special handling for small screens.\n\n| Breakpoint | Strategy                          |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|\n| < 768px    | Stack rows as cards OR horizontal scroll with sticky first column |\n| ≥ 768px    | Standard table layout             |\n\nPrefer card stacking for < 5 columns. Use horizontal scroll with a sticky first column for wide tables.\n\n### 4. Split View (List + Detail)\n\n| Breakpoint | Behavior                                |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| < 1024px   | List and detail as separate views (navigate between) |\n| ≥ 1024px   | Side-by-side: list 320px, detail fills remaining |\n\n### 5. Form Layout\n\n| Breakpoint | Strategy                          |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|\n| < 640px    | Single column, full-width inputs  |\n| ≥ 640px    | Two-column for related fields (first/last name) |\n| ≥ 1024px   | Sidebar labels (label left, input right) |\n\n### 6. Hero / Marketing Section\n\n| Breakpoint | Strategy                           |\n|------------|------------------------------------|\n| < 768px    | Stack: image below text, centered  |\n| ≥ 768px    | Side-by-side: text left, image right |\n\n## Container Strategy\n\nUse a centered max-width container for content:\n\n| Context    | Max Width | Padding          |\n|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Prose      | 680px     | 16px horizontal  |\n| App content| 1200px    | 16–32px          |\n| Full-bleed | 100%      | 0                |\n\n## Touch Target Sizes\n\n- Minimum tap target: 44x44px (WCAG) / 48x48px (Material)\n- Minimum spacing between targets: 8px\n- On mobile, increase button padding and link hit areas\n\n## Responsive Typography\n\n| Element    | Mobile   | Desktop  |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Body       | 16px     | 16px     |\n| H1         | 28px     | 36px     |\n| H2         | 22px     | 28px     |\n| H3         | 18px     | 22px     |\n| Small/Meta | 13px     | 14px     |\n\nUse `clamp()` for fluid scaling: `font-size: clamp(1.75rem, 1.5rem + 1vw, 2.25rem)`.\n\n## Specifying Responsive Behavior\n\nWhen writing component specs, always include a responsive table:\n\n```markdown\n## Responsive Behavior\n\n| Breakpoint | Changes                              |\n|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| < 640px    | Stack vertically, hide secondary actions |\n| 640–1023px | Two-column layout, show all actions  |\n| ≥ 1024px   | Three-column, inline filters         |\n```\n"}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what to build and acceptance criteria\n   - `artifacts/architecture.md` — system design, data models, API contracts\n   - `artifacts/api-contracts.yaml` — expected API shapes\n   - `artifacts/ui-specs/` — component specs and wireframes\n   - `artifacts/handoff/` — notes from previous agents\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Read the existing codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and tech stack\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `js-nextjs` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference for Next.js projects:\n\n- **nextjs-app-router** — File conventions, routing patterns, layouts, metadata API, loading/error boundaries\n- **react-patterns** — Server vs Client Components, Suspense, data fetching, composition strategies\n- **nextjs-config** — next.config.mjs options, environment variables, middleware patterns\n- **nextjs-testing** — Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright setup and patterns\n- **nextjs-performance** — ISR, streaming, image optimization, caching, bundle analysis\n- **api-routes** — Route Handlers, input validation, error handling, auth patterns\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the task, spec, architecture docs, and relevant source code. Know what you're building before writing any code.\n2. **Plan** — Identify the files to create/modify. Think through the approach before coding.\n3. **Implement** — Write the code. Follow existing patterns and conventions.\n4. **Self-test** — Run the code. Fix errors. Make sure it actually works.\n5. **Handoff** — Write a clear handoff doc for the QA agent.\n\n## Code Standards\n\n- Follow the existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure\n- Use TypeScript with strict types. Avoid `any`.\n- Write small, focused functions. Each function does one thing.\n- Handle errors at API boundaries. Use early returns for guard clauses.\n- Name variables and functions descriptively. The code should read like prose.\n- Don't leave TODO comments — either implement it or note it in the handoff doc.\n- Don't add dead code, commented-out code, or unused imports.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match existing patterns.** If the codebase uses a certain ORM, router, or state library, use the same one. Don't introduce new dependencies without a strong reason.\n- **Don't over-engineer.** Implement what the spec asks for. No premature abstractions, no \"nice-to-haves\" the spec didn't mention.\n- **Run the code.** Don't just write it — execute it and verify it works. If tests exist, run them.\n- **Fix what you break.** If existing tests fail after your changes, fix them. Check with `npm test` or the project's test command.\n- **Respect architecture decisions.** If an architecture doc or ADR exists, follow it. Don't deviate without documenting why.\n- **Database migrations** must be reversible. Include both up and down.\n\n## Output\n\n### Source Code\nWrite/modify source code in the existing project structure.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Start monitor server in a local environment that allows loopback HTTP listen.\\n2. Open monitor UI, pick a run with active/ongoing events.\\n3. Verify IA layout order and hierarchy:\\n   - header and phase first, timeline primary, context adjacent/stacked based on breakpoint, secondary tabs available.\\n4. Verify summary-first rows and payload toggles:\\n   - row shows event type/time/preview;\\n   - `Show payload` expands JSON;\\n   - refresh does not collapse already expanded rows.\\n5. Verify incremental prepend behavior:\\n   - scroll to mid-list;\\n   - click `Load older events`;\\n   - confirm older rows appear above without visible jump away from current reading line.\\n6. Verify preserved selection/focus:\\n   - select a row;\\n   - trigger `Sync now`;\\n   - confirm same row remains selected and keyboard focus remains on same row control.\\n7. Verify follow pause/recovery:\\n   - scroll up from bottom;\\n   - confirm follow-paused notice + `Jump to latest` visibility;\\n   - click `Jump to latest` and confirm tail-follow resumes.\\n8. Verify pause/resume semantics:\\n   - click `Pause updates`, wait beyond poll interval, confirm no automatic content changes;\\n   - click `Sync now`, confirm one refresh;\\n   - click `Resume updates`, confirm periodic updates return.\\n9. Verify tabs (`Artifacts`, `Logs`, `Result JSON`) still load expected content.\\n\\n## Explicit Verification Notes: Jitter Reduction\\n- Goal: reduce visual jump/flicker during periodic refresh and load-more actions.\\n- Pass indicators:\\n  - Timeline does not flash/repaint as a full blank-then-refill list on poll.\\n  - Expanded payload rows remain open through updates.\\n  - Selected row highlight does not drop/reset during updates.\\n  - Viewport anchor remains stable when prepending older events.\\n  - Keyboard focus does not unexpectedly move to top/header on refresh.\\n- Recommended QA checks:\\n  - Run `Sync now` repeatedly while a row is selected and payload is expanded; verify no state loss.\\n  - Keep timeline at tail, allow automatic refresh, verify only new rows append and no list-wide jump occurs.\\n  - During `Load older events`, place cursor over a known row and verify its on-screen position remains effectively stable after prepend.\\n- Known non-goal:\\n  - If event identity truly changes (different signature/order), row reuse may change for affected items; this is expected and not a regression.\\n\\n## Environment Setup\\n- No new environment variables.\\n- No new dependencies.\\n- No database migrations.\\n\\n## Notes\\n- Sandbox limitations in this developer run:\\n  - `npm test` could not run successfully in this environment because `vitest` is unavailable at runtime.\\n  - Browser/server smoke validation could not be executed here because local listen is blocked (`EPERM` on `127.0.0.1`).\\n- QA should run the above verification in a normal local/dev environment where monitor server startup is allowed.\\nEOF\"}","call_id":"call_Fjqrg1PsCZy6UNHgLjmi3xov"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Start monitor server in a local environment that allows loopback HTTP listen.\n2. Open monitor UI, pick a run with active/ongoing events.\n3. Verify IA layout order and hierarchy:\n   - header and phase first, timeline primary, context adjacent/stacked based on breakpoint, secondary tabs available.\n4. Verify summary-first rows and payload toggles:\n   - row shows event type/time/preview;\n   - `Show payload` expands JSON;\n   - refresh does not collapse already expanded rows.\n5. Verify incremental prepend behavior:\n   - scroll to mid-list;\n   - click `Load older events`;\n   - confirm older rows appear above without visible jump away from current reading line.\n6. Verify preserved selection/focus:\n   - select a row;\n   - trigger `Sync now`;\n   - confirm same row remains selected and keyboard focus remains on same row control.\n7. Verify follow pause/recovery:\n   - scroll up from bottom;\n   - confirm follow-paused notice + `Jump to latest` visibility;\n   - click `Jump to latest` and confirm tail-follow resumes.\n8. Verify pause/resume semantics:\n   - click `Pause updates`, wait beyond poll interval, confirm no automatic content changes;\n   - click `Sync now`, confirm one refresh;\n   - click `Resume updates`, confirm periodic updates return.\n9. Verify tabs (`Artifacts`, `Logs`, `Result JSON`) still load expected content.\n\n## Explicit Verification Notes: Jitter Reduction\n- Goal: reduce visual jump/flicker during periodic refresh and load-more actions.\n- Pass indicators:\n  - Timeline does not flash/repaint as a full blank-then-refill list on poll.\n  - Expanded payload rows remain open through updates.\n  - Selected row highlight does not drop/reset during updates.\n  - Viewport anchor remains stable when prepending older events.\n  - Keyboard focus does not unexpectedly move to top/header on refresh.\n- Recommended QA checks:\n  - Run `Sync now` repeatedly while a row is selected and payload is expanded; verify no state loss.\n  - Keep timeline at tail, allow automatic refresh, verify only new rows append and no list-wide jump occurs.\n  - During `Load older events`, place cursor over a known row and verify its on-screen position remains effectively stable after prepend.\n- Known non-goal:\n  - If event identity truly changes (different signature/order), row reuse may change for affected items; this is expected and not a regression.\n\n## Environment Setup\n- No new environment variables.\n- No new dependencies.\n- No database migrations.\n\n## Notes\n- Sandbox limitations in this developer run:\n  - `npm test` could not run successfully in this environment because `vitest` is unavailable at runtime.\n  - Browser/server smoke validation could not be executed here because local listen is blocked (`EPERM` on `127.0.0.1`).\n- QA should run the above verification in a normal local/dev environment where monitor server startup is allowed.\n"}}

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what to build and acceptance criteria\n   - `artifacts/architecture.md` — system design, data models, API contracts\n   - `artifacts/api-contracts.yaml` — expected API shapes\n   - `artifacts/ui-specs/` — component specs and wireframes\n   - `artifacts/handoff/` — notes from previous agents\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Read the existing codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and tech stack\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `js-nextjs` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference for Next.js projects:\n\n- **nextjs-app-router** — File conventions, routing patterns, layouts, metadata API, loading/error boundaries\n- **react-patterns** — Server vs Client Components, Suspense, data fetching, composition strategies\n- **nextjs-config** — next.config.mjs options, environment variables, middleware patterns\n- **nextjs-testing** — Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright setup and patterns\n- **nextjs-performance** — ISR, streaming, image optimization, caching, bundle analysis\n- **api-routes** — Route Handlers, input validation, error handling, auth patterns\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the task, spec, architecture docs, and relevant source code. Know what you're building before writing any code.\n2. **Plan** — Identify the files to create/modify. Think through the approach before coding.\n3. **Implement** — Write the code. Follow existing patterns and conventions.\n4. **Self-test** — Run the code. Fix errors. Make sure it actually works.\n5. **Handoff** — Write a clear handoff doc for the QA agent.\n\n## Code Standards\n\n- Follow the existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure\n- Use TypeScript with strict types. Avoid `any`.\n- Write small, focused functions. Each function does one thing.\n- Handle errors at API boundaries. Use early returns for guard clauses.\n- Name variables and functions descriptively. The code should read like prose.\n- Don't leave TODO comments — either implement it or note it in the handoff doc.\n- Don't add dead code, commented-out code, or unused imports.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match existing patterns.** If the codebase uses a certain ORM, router, or state library, use the same one. Don't introduce new dependencies without a strong reason.\n- **Don't over-engineer.** Implement what the spec asks for. No premature abstractions, no \"nice-to-haves\" the spec didn't mention.\n- **Run the code.** Don't just write it — execute it and verify it works. If tests exist, run them.\n- **Fix what you break.** If existing tests fail after your changes, fix them. Check with `npm test` or the project's test command.\n- **Respect architecture decisions.** If an architecture doc or ADR exists, follow it. Don't deviate without documenting why.\n- **Database migrations** must be reversible. Include both up and down.\n\n## Output\n\n### Source Code\nWrite/modify source code in the existing project structure.

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what to build and acceptance criteria\n   - `artifacts/architecture.md` — system design, data models, API contracts\n   - `artifacts/api-contracts.yaml` — expected API shapes\n   - `artifacts/ui-specs/` — component specs and wireframes\n   - `artifacts/handoff/` — notes from previous agents\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Read the existing codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and tech stack\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `js-nextjs` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference for Next.js projects:\n\n- **nextjs-app-router** — File conventions, routing patterns, layouts, metadata API, loading/error boundaries\n- **react-patterns** — Server vs Client Components, Suspense, data fetching, composition strategies\n- **nextjs-config** — next.config.mjs options, environment variables, middleware patterns\n- **nextjs-testing** — Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright setup and patterns\n- **nextjs-performance** — ISR, streaming, image optimization, caching, bundle analysis\n- **api-routes** — Route Handlers, input validation, error handling, auth patterns\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the task, spec, architecture docs, and relevant source code. Know what you're building before writing any code.\n2. **Plan** — Identify the files to create/modify. Think through the approach before coding.\n3. **Implement** — Write the code. Follow existing patterns and conventions.\n4. **Self-test** — Run the code. Fix errors. Make sure it actually works.\n5. **Handoff** — Write a clear handoff doc for the QA agent.\n\n## Code Standards\n\n- Follow the existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure\n- Use TypeScript with strict types. Avoid `any`.\n- Write small, focused functions. Each function does one thing.\n- Handle errors at API boundaries. Use early returns for guard clauses.\n- Name variables and functions descriptively. The code should read like prose.\n- Don't leave TODO comments — either implement it or note it in the handoff doc.\n- Don't add dead code, commented-out code, or unused imports.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match existing patterns.** If the codebase uses a certain ORM, router, or state library, use the same one. Don't introduce new dependencies without a strong reason.\n- **Don't over-engineer.** Implement what the spec asks for. No premature abstractions, no \"nice-to-haves\" the spec didn't mention.\n- **Run the code.** Don't just write it — execute it and verify it works. If tests exist, run them.\n- **Fix what you break.** If existing tests fail after your changes, fix them. Check with `npm test` or the project's test command.\n- **Respect architecture decisions.** If an architecture doc or ADR exists, follow it. Don't deviate without documenting why.\n- **Database migrations** must be reversible. Include both up and down.\n\n## Output\n\n### Source Code\nWrite/modify source code in the existing project structure. Follow the project's directory conventions.\n\n### `artifacts/handoff/dev-to-qa.md`\n```markdown\n# Developer → QA Handoff\n\n## What Changed\n- List every file created or modified\n- Describe what each change does\n\n## How to Test\n- Steps to run the feature locally\n- Expected behavior for happy path\n- Known edge cases to test\n\n## Environment Setup\n- Any new env vars needed\n- Any new dependencies (`npm install` should handle it)\n- Database migrations to run (if any)\n\n## Notes\n- Anything the QA agent should know\n- Design decisions that might affect testing\n- Areas of uncertainty or risk\n```\n\n### `.agent-result.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"complete\",\n  \"summary\": \"Implemented CSV export feature with streaming for large datasets\",\n  \"artifacts_created\": [\"src/api/export.ts\", \"src/components/ExportButton.tsx\"],\n  \"artifacts_modified\": [\"src/api/routes.ts\", \"src/types/report.ts\"],\n  \"issues\": [],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"files_created\": 2,\n    \"files_modified\": 2,\n    \"lines_added\": 245,\n    \"lines_removed\": 12\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf blocked or unable to complete:\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"blocked\",\n  \"summary\": \"Cannot implement — missing database schema for reports table\",\n  \"artifacts_created\": [],\n  \"artifacts_modified\": [],\n  \"issues\": [\n    \"No reports table exists in the database.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages.

Read `.agent-task.md` for your specific task\n2. Read these files if they exist:\n   - `artifacts/product-spec.md` — what to build and acceptance criteria\n   - `artifacts/architecture.md` — system design, data models, API contracts\n   - `artifacts/api-contracts.yaml` — expected API shapes\n   - `artifacts/ui-specs/` — component specs and wireframes\n   - `artifacts/handoff/` — notes from previous agents\n3. Check `.agent-context/` for previous step outputs\n4. Read the existing codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and tech stack\n\n## Plugin Skills Available\n\nThe `js-nextjs` plugin provides these skills — use them as reference for Next.js projects:\n\n- **nextjs-app-router** — File conventions, routing patterns, layouts, metadata API, loading/error boundaries\n- **react-patterns** — Server vs Client Components, Suspense, data fetching, composition strategies\n- **nextjs-config** — next.config.mjs options, environment variables, middleware patterns\n- **nextjs-testing** — Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright setup and patterns\n- **nextjs-performance** — ISR, streaming, image optimization, caching, bundle analysis\n- **api-routes** — Route Handlers, input validation, error handling, auth patterns\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand** — Read the task, spec, architecture docs, and relevant source code. Know what you're building before writing any code.\n2. **Plan** — Identify the files to create/modify. Think through the approach before coding.\n3. **Implement** — Write the code. Follow existing patterns and conventions.\n4. **Self-test** — Run the code. Fix errors. Make sure it actually works.\n5. **Handoff** — Write a clear handoff doc for the QA agent.\n\n## Code Standards\n\n- Follow the existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure\n- Use TypeScript with strict types. Avoid `any`.\n- Write small, focused functions. Each function does one thing.\n- Handle errors at API boundaries. Use early returns for guard clauses.\n- Name variables and functions descriptively. The code should read like prose.\n- Don't leave TODO comments — either implement it or note it in the handoff doc.\n- Don't add dead code, commented-out code, or unused imports.\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Match existing patterns.** If the codebase uses a certain ORM, router, or state library, use the same one. Don't introduce new dependencies without a strong reason.\n- **Don't over-engineer.** Implement what the spec asks for. No premature abstractions, no \"nice-to-haves\" the spec didn't mention.\n- **Run the code.** Don't just write it — execute it and verify it works. If tests exist, run them.\n- **Fix what you break.** If existing tests fail after your changes, fix them. Check with `npm test` or the project's test command.\n- **Respect architecture decisions.** If an architecture doc or ADR exists, follow it. Don't deviate without documenting why.\n- **Database migrations** must be reversible. Include both up and down.\n\n## Output\n\n### Source Code\nWrite/modify source code in the existing project structure. Follow the project's directory conventions.\n\n### `artifacts/handoff/dev-to-qa.md`\n```markdown\n# Developer → QA Handoff\n\n## What Changed\n- List every file created or modified\n- Describe what each change does\n\n## How to Test\n- Steps to run the feature locally\n- Expected behavior for happy path\n- Known edge cases to test\n\n## Environment Setup\n- Any new env vars needed\n- Any new dependencies (`npm install` should handle it)\n- Database migrations to run (if any)\n\n## Notes\n- Anything the QA agent should know\n- Design decisions that might affect testing\n- Areas of uncertainty or risk\n```\n\n### `.agent-result.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"complete\",\n  \"summary\": \"Implemented CSV export feature with streaming for large datasets\",\n  \"artifacts_created\": [\"src/api/export.ts\", \"src/components/ExportButton.tsx\"],\n  \"artifacts_modified\": [\"src/api/routes.ts\", \"src/types/report.ts\"],\n  \"issues\": [],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"files_created\": 2,\n    \"files_modified\": 2,\n    \"lines_added\": 245,\n    \"lines_removed\": 12\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf blocked or unable to complete:\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"blocked\",\n  \"summary\": \"Cannot implement — missing database schema for reports table\",\n  \"artifacts_created\": [],\n  \"artifacts_modified\": [],\n  \"issues\": [\n    \"No reports table exists in the database.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- accessibility-audit: WCAG 2.1 AA structured audit checklist for UI components and pages. Use when reviewing designs or implementations for accessibility compliance. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)\n- color-typography: Color palette and type scale definitions with WCAG contrast compliance guidance. Use when establishing or auditing a project's color and typography system. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/color-typography/SKILL.md)\n- component-spec: Write structured component specifications from a template — props, states, variants, interactions, and accessibility. Use when specifying a new UI component or documenting an existing one. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/component-spec/SKILL.md)\n- design-system: Define and audit design tokens — spacing scale, naming conventions, visual language, and token usage guidelines. Use when establishing or reviewing a project's design system foundations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/design-system/SKILL.md)\n- responsive-layout: Common responsive layout patterns with breakpoint definitions and implementation guidance. Use when designing or specifying how components and pages adapt across screen sizes. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/responsive-layout/SKILL.md)\n- wireframe-preview: Generate renderable React/HTML wireframe previews for UI designs. Use when the team needs a visual representation of a proposed layout before full implementation. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/wireframe-preview/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /private/var/folders/3h/qx4txpps3ps2sfy2bwc4_wlh0000gn/T/agentsdlc/sprintfoundry-self/run-1771004861240-76pypp/.codex-home/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
