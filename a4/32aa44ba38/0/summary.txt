All tasks complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Changes Made

**`monitor/server.mjs`**
- Removed `publicDir` and `publicV2Dir` constants (no longer needed)
- `/v2` and all sub-paths now return HTTP 404 with a descriptive message and an explanatory comment (chosen over redirect so stale scripts fail loudly)
- `GET /` and all unmatched routes now serve from `publicV3Dir` (v3 is the new default)
- `serveStatic()` default `rootDir` updated to `publicV3Dir`

**Deleted directories**
- `monitor/public-v2/` — entire v2 UI removed
- `monitor/public/` — entire legacy v1 UI removed

**`README.md`** — Updated monitor quick-start URL from `/v3` → `/`; updated repo structure description

**`docs/monitor.md`** — Updated UI Versions section to show v3 at `/`, `/v3` as a legacy alias, and `/v2` as removed (404)

**`artifacts/handoff/dev-to-qa.md`** — QA handoff written

**`.agent-result.json`** — Result file written
