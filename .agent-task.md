# Task for qa Agent

## Task Description
Run UI/behavior regression and acceptance validation for project/run selection, refresh and auto-refresh, logs tab switching, event/plan loading, accessibility keyboard reachability, and responsive checks at 390x844; explicitly report whether jitter is resolved and what was measured.

## Context
- Read ticket details in `.agent-task.md`

## Previous Steps
### Step 2 (developer)
Status: complete
Summary: Implemented Run Monitor IA and behavior updates in public UI: summary-first timeline rows with payload toggles, load-more event pagination, active step/next-action derivation, pause/resume live updates with manual sync, and incremental DOM patching that preserves selection, scroll, and focus without changing server contracts.
Artifacts: artifacts/handoff/dev-to-qa.md
Issues: Unable to run full test suite in this sandbox: `npm test` fails because `vitest` is not installed in the runtime.; Unable to run live server smoke test in this sandbox: local listen blocked with EPERM on 127.0.0.1.

### Step 3 (developer)
Status: complete
Summary: Rewrote the developer-to-QA handoff with explicit IA decisions, incremental update strategy, preserved UI state rules, and concrete jitter-reduction verification notes aligned to the implemented monitor behavior.
Issues: Runtime verification could not be executed in this sandbox because local HTTP listen is blocked with EPERM on 127.0.0.1.; Automated test execution could not be completed in this sandbox because vitest is unavailable at runtime.
