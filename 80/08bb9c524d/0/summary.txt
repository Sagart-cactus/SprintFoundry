All changes are in. Here's a summary of what was done:

**`monitor/server.mjs`**
- `inferStatus()` now detects `human_gate.requested` → `"waiting_human_review"`
- `GET /api/reviews?project=&run=` — lists pending review files
- `POST /api/review/decide` — writes `.decision.json` (same format as CLI `review` command)

**`monitor/public-v3/app.js`**
- `prettyStatus()` shows "Awaiting Review" for `waiting_human_review`
- Board cards get amber left border for this status

**`monitor/public-v3/run.html`**
- Added `<section id="review-panel">` between summary bar and plan panel

**`monitor/public-v3/run.js`**
- Human gate event labels in timeline
- `refresh()` fetches pending reviews when status is `waiting_human_review`
- `renderReviewPanel()` shows summary, artifacts, feedback textarea, approve/reject buttons
- `submitReviewDecision()` POSTs to `/api/review/decide` and refreshes

**`monitor/public-v3/styles.css`**
- Amber badge/chip styles for `waiting_human_review`
- Review panel card with warning border, approve (green) / reject (red) buttons

You can test it by restarting the monitor and navigating to any run that's in a human gate state. The approve/reject panel will appear automatically.
