QA validation is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

## QA Validation Summary

**All 144 tests pass** with no failures or regressions.

### Acceptance Criteria — All Verified

1. **Multi-step run produces one commit per successful changing step**
   - `orchestration-service.test.ts: commit checkpoint: happy path` — confirms `commitStepCheckpoint` called exactly once per completed step (2 calls for 2-step dev+qa plan) with correct args (workspacePath, runId, stepNumber, agentId)

2. **No-diff steps do not create empty commits**
   - `git-manager.test.ts: no-diff skip` — confirms `commitStepCheckpoint` returns `false` and `git commit` is never called when `git diff --staged --quiet` exits 0
   - `orchestration-service.test.ts: no-diff skip` — confirms no `step.committed` event is emitted, run still completes normally

3. **Commit failures surface in events/logs and run.status reflects failure**
   - `orchestration-service.test.ts: commit failure` — confirms `run.status = "failed"`, `run.error` contains `"Git checkpoint commit failed at step 1"`, `step.failed` event emitted with the git error detail, and PR creation is not attempted

4. **Existing PR creation behavior still works with per-step commits present**
   - `git-manager.test.ts: PR creation compat` — confirms `gh pr create` succeeds without any extra commits
   - `orchestration-service.test.ts: PR creation compat` — confirms `createPullRequest` is called once and `run.pr_url` is set correctly after per-step commits

### Test Coverage
- **7 unit tests** in `tests/git-manager.test.ts` covering `commitStepCheckpoint` happy path, message format, no-diff skip, git commit failure, git add failure, spawnSync error, and PR compat
- **6 integration tests** in `tests/orchestration-service.test.ts` covering the orchestration layer commit-checkpoint logic
