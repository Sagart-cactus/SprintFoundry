Title: Redesign the Run Monitor with strict adherence to this IA and workflow model for SprintFoundry. This
Description: Redesign the Run Monitor with strict adherence to this IA and workflow model for SprintFoundry. This is an enforcement task: do not provide a stylistic refresh only. Implement structural UX changes.

Non-negotiable goals:
1) Reduce cognitive load by making run health and next action obvious in under 5 seconds.
2) Replace JSON-first presentation with human-readable summaries + progressive disclosure.
3) Eliminate auto-refresh jitter via incremental patching and state preservation.
4) Keep monitor/server.mjs endpoints and query contracts unchanged.

Files to change:
- monitor/public/index.html
- monitor/public/styles.css
- monitor/public/app.js
Do not modify monitor/server.mjs.

Required IA (must implement):
A) Top Run Header strip:
- Project select, Run select, status chip, stage chip, last sync timestamp, Pause live updates toggle, Sync now button.
- Show clear run context and current state at top.

B) Phase Progress Bar:
- Visual phase flow representing pipeline (Plan -> Dev -> QA -> Security -> PR).
- Highlight current phase and completion state.

C) Main content split:
- Left: Workflow Timeline with human-readable event rows.
- Right: Active Step + Decision Context panel.

D) Secondary content:
- Artifacts digest panel (key artifacts first, expandable for full list).
- Diagnostics/Logs panel (tabbed) as secondary, not primary.

Required behavior:
1) Human-readable timeline rows
- Convert event types into readable text labels.
- Show concise summary first.
- Raw payload hidden behind per-event “Show payload” toggle.
- Default to latest N events with “Load more”.

2) Active Step panel
- Show current agent, task summary, status, started/completed time, tokens.
- Include “Next action” / “Blocker” text derived from run status/events where possible.

3) Jitter-free updates
- No full DOM re-render on auto-refresh ticks.
- Patch only changed regions (header chips, updated step status, appended events, log pane content).
- Preserve:
  - selected run/project
  - selected logs tab
  - timeline payload open/closed states
  - scroll positions in timeline and logs
  - focused control
- Include pause-live-updates mode and explicit manual sync button.

4) Responsive rules
- Mobile-first stacked layout with stable spacing and no horizontal overflow.
- Logs and artifacts should collapse into accordions/drawers on small screens.
- Keep controls usable and unclipped at 390x844.

5) Accessibility
- Keyboard reachable controls for all toggles.
- ARIA labels/attributes for disclosure controls and timeline semantics.
- Visible focus states and no keyboard traps.

6) Guardrails
- No API contract changes.
- No regressions in existing flows:
  - project/run selection
  - refresh and auto-refresh
  - logs tab switching
  - event and plan loading

Deliverables:
- Updated monitor/public/index.html, styles.css, app.js.
- artifacts/handoff/dev-to-qa.md describing IA decisions and incremental update strategy.
- QA output must explicitly confirm whether jitter is resolved and what was measured.

Definition of done:
- UI clearly emphasizes run status, active step, and next action.
- Timeline is summary-first with optional payload reveal.
- Auto-refresh feels stable (no full-screen flicker/jumps).
Priority: p1
Labels: none
Available agents: product (product), architect (architect), developer (developer), go-developer (developer), qa (qa), go-qa (qa), security (security), ui-ux (ui-ux), devops (devops)
Rules: A QA-role agent must always run after code changes are produced; Security agent must run when ticket touches auth/payments; Security agent must run when auth-related files are modified; P0 features always require human approval before merge
