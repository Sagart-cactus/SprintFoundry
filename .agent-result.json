After each step completes with status 'complete', GitManager stages all changes and creates a commit with message 'chore(agentsdlc): run <run_id> step <n> <agent_id>'. Skips the commit when there are no staged changes. Commit failures emit a step.failed event and mark the step/run as failed. PR creation compatibility is maintained.",
