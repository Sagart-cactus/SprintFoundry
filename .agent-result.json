Per-step git commit checkpoint implementation fully validated against all 4 acceptance criteria: (1) multi-step run produces one commit per successful changing step, (2) no-diff steps are skipped without empty commits, (3) commit failures surface in step.failed events and mark run.status=failed, (4) PR creation via gh CLI works correctly after per-step commits. 13 targeted commit-checkpoint tests (7 unit in git-manager.test.ts + 6 integration in orchestration-service.test.ts) all pass. No regressions detected.",
