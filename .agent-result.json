The test 'cloneAndBranch calls git clone + checkout' in tests/git-manager.test.ts:46 asserts toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2) but cloneAndBranch now makes 3 spawnSync calls (git clone, git checkout, entire enable). The developer must either update the test assertion to accommodate the new call or guard tryEnableEntire so it does not fire during tests.",
