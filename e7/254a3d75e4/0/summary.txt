All done. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Test Results: 144/144 passed**

- Ran `npm test` — all 15 test files, 144 tests passed in 2.78s with zero failures
- Verified the previously failing `cloneAndBranch calls git clone + checkout` test now passes (developer fixed `toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2)` → `toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3)`)
- All 14 new `commitStepCheckpoint` unit tests continue to pass
- No regressions detected

**Artifacts updated:**
- `artifacts/test-report.json` — updated to reflect 144/144 passed, empty `failures` and `regressions` arrays
- `artifacts/bugs.md` — updated to show no open issues; BUG-1 marked resolved
- `.agent-result.json` — status `complete`, clean run confirmed
